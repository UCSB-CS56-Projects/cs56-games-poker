Description of Project
======================

This project is a GUI application that runs a poker game in the style of "Texas Hold'em," with two decks, as stated by the README. 


User Stories
============
	
The user can do the following:
		
1. **Single Player Game** - Start a game by pressing the "Play Single Player" button. The user will compete against AI.

2. Create a Poker Server **_(disabled by previous contributers)_**. This button creates a local server and returns its IP address, which the user then enters in a separate session via the "Connect to Poker Server" button. The user can also distribute the IP address to other players willing to join a game.
	
3. Connect to Poker Server **_(disabled by previous contributers)_**. Takes an IP address and connects the user to its corresponding poker game. Inputting "localhost" or the IP address "127.0.0.1" connects the user to their local server.

4. **Create Poker Chat Server** - Clicking this button creates a socket server for a chat program (similar to #2).
 
5. **Connect to Poker Chat Server** - Joins a Chat Server by taking an IP address and connecting (similar to #3).


Proposed User Stories
=====================

1. **Adjust AI difficulty** - Currently, there is no option to change the difficulty level on Single Player Mode. This would present the player with "Easy," "Intermediate," and "Hard" difficulties.
	
2. **Play against multiple AIs** - The user only encounters one AI in Single Player; the option to play against two or more increasesthe game's complexity and playability.
	
3. **Remove redundancies in creating servers** - Creating a local server
currently depends too much on the user. The program should take the generated IP address and automatically produce a server, not
return the IP address for the user to input.

4. **Restore Multiplayer and Servers** - Reimplement these features back into the game.


Software Status
===============

When the game runs, a window pops up with three buttons: Single Player Mode, Create a Chat Server, and Connect to Chat. Single Player generates a game between the user and AI, which works smoothly. However, creating a Chat Server does not function as well as it could. An IP address is returned, but the program hangs immediately after. Connecting to the Chat Server on the local machine lets the user input their chat name and creates a chat window, but nothing occurs when the user inputs a string.


README.md Quality
=================

The previous two generations of programmers wrote a brief assessment of the software in its final states. Comments range from the developers' courses of action to their visions for the future of the game. These notes provide a starting point for project development.

There is also a description of the game's mechanics and features, including several screenshots. _How_ the code actually works is hidden in this file; it basically instructs the user on the GUI and how to run the application.


build.xml State
===============

The build.xml is neatly optimized. All targets have relevant names and brief, informative descriptions.


Code Organization and Quality
=============================

The code is organized fairly well. The purpose of each class and method is clear, and the classes do not have overlapping functionality. Additionally, it is easy to see how each class relates to the others by examining each class's members and method signatures. The
Player class has a Hand object and PokerGame object as members, and the Hand class has an arrayList of Card objects and an int variable representing the Hand's value. The TableCards object also has an arrayList of Card objects, in addition to two Card objects
representing the turn and river cards. Although the Card class itself is simple, with its only members being primitives representing the suit and value, using it often requires the use of the Deck class. The Deck class contains two arrayLists of Card objects, one
representing the active cards and one representing the discarded cards. Whenever an object wants a Card object, it generally has to "ask" the Deck object for a card. The Deck object responds by returning a Card from the active list while also moving the Card to the
discarded cards list. The exception to this is the CompareHands class, which works directly with the Card objects to compare the value of each player's hand. While the classes themselves are organized well, many of the methods could be refactored to increase the overall 
code quality and organization. Numerous methods are much lengthier than they should be, and much of the code in the methods could be factored out into helper functions, making it much easier to understand how a method works. Currently, it is difficult to determine how
some of the methods work due to large blocks of nested if/else statements. Most of this decision-making code should be in private helper methods instead of directly in the method. This is an especially big issue in CompareHands.java, in which most of the methods are
extremely lengthy and difficult to follow due to nested if/else statements. The game itself is run using the main method in PokerMain.java. However, all the main method does is display an option screen to the player to choose between single player, joining a chat room,
or creating a chat room, and create an object to run the selected option. Currently, if the user chooses to create a poker chat server, the window becomes unclickable and does not exit, and must remain open for the chat server to continue running. In order to connect to
the just created chat server, the user must launch another instance of the game and connect to the IP returned by the first instance of the game. This functionality that the code for the opening screen can (and probably should) be improved. The code itself is organized
fine, but the functionality could be improved. The code for PokerChatClient and PokerChatServer is self contained, and unlike the classes for the actual game, the methods are much more concise and do not need to be refactored. This code should only be modified if working
directly on the chat client or server. If the user chooses to play a single player game, the game is launched using the PokerSinglePlayer class, which inherits its GUI code from the PokerGameGui class. PokerGameGui extends the PokerGame class and inherits all of the
relevant variables representing the current game state. Because of this, PokerSinglePlayer is able to access any relevant game state variables. Examples of these variables include two references to Player objects, one for each player, a reference to a Deck object to
represent the deck, and a reference to a TableCards object to represent the current cards on the table. Additionally, there are numerous methods for the various actions that will happen throughout a game, such as fold() and collectPot(). Since much of the code for the
actual game is in the PokerGame class and not PokerSinglePlayer, it would not be difficult to extend PokerGame's functionality to game modes other than 1v1 with an AI opponent. Overall, the main issue with the code base is a lack of helper functions. Much of the code
could be much cleaner and easier to read if there were more helper functions, and if trying to improve code quality and organization, helper functions should be a priority.


Test Coverage
=============

The test coverage for this project is abysmal. The only class tested is the CompareHands class, and these tests could be expanded to test more edge cases as well as provide more comprehensive testing in general. The test coverage could be expanded to ensure that the
classes representing various parts of the game (Card, Hand, etc.) are functioning properly. This could be done by testing the constructor as well as the various methods of each class. There could be tests ensuring the getters and setters are working properly, as well as
tests for the methods that use multiple classes. Additionally, PokerGame, PokerGameGui, and PokerSinglePlayer should all have their various methods tested to ensure that the game itself is functioning properly. One way to test these functions is by ensuring all of the
game state variables are correct after a method is called.
