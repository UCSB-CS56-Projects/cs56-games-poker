Description of Project
======================

This project is a GUI application that runs a poker game in the style of "Texas Hold'em," with two decks, as stated by the README. 


User Stories
============
	
The user can do the following:
		
1. **Single Player Game** - Start a game by pressing the "Play Single Player" button. The user will compete against AI.

2. Create a Poker Server **_(disabled by previous contributers)_**. This button creates a local server and returns its IP address, which the user then enters in a separate session via the "Connect to Poker Server" button. The user can also distribute the IP address to other players willing to join a game.
	
3. Connect to Poker Server **_(disabled by previous contributers)_**. Takes an IP address and connects the user to its corresponding poker game. Inputting "localhost" or the IP address "127.0.0.1" connects the user to their local server.

4. **Create Poker Chat Server** - Clicking this button creates a socket server for a chat program (similar to #2).
 
5. **Connect to Poker Chat Server** - Joins a Chat Server by taking an IP address and connecting (similar to #3).


Proposed User Stories
=====================

1. **Adjust AI difficulty** - Currently, there is no option to change the difficulty level on Single Player Mode. This would present the player with "Easy," "Intermediate," and "Hard" difficulties.
	
2. **Play against multiple AIs** - The user only encounters one AI in Single Player; the option to play against two or more increasesthe game's complexity and playability.
	
3. **Remove redundancies in creating servers** - Creating a local server
currently depends too much on the user. The program should take the generated IP address and automatically produce a server, not
return the IP address for the user to input.

4. Restore Multiplayer and Servers.


Software Status
===============

When the game runs, a window pops up with three buttons: Single Player Mode, Create a Chat Server, and Connect to Chat. Single Player generates a game between the user and AI, which works smoothly. However, creating a Chat Server does not function aswell as it could. An IP address is returned, but the program hangs immediately after. Connecting to the Chat Server on the local machine lets the user input their chat name and creates a chat window, but nothing occurs when the user inputs a string.


README.md Quality
=================

The previous two generations of programmers wrote a brief assessment of the software in its final states. Comments range from the developers' courses of action to their visions for the future of the game. These notes provide a starting point for project development.

There is also a description of the game's mechanics and features, including several screenshots. _How_ the code actually works is hidden in this file; it basically instructs the user on the GUI and how to run the application.


build.xml State
===============

The build.xml is neatly optimized. All targets have relevant names and brief, informative descriptions.
