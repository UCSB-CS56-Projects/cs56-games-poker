New Issues
==========

1. **[Adjust AI difficulty](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-poker/issues/64) (300 pts)** - Currently, there is no option to change the difficulty level on Single Player Mode. This would present the player with "Easy," "Intermediate," and "Hard" difficulties. As of now, the AI is fairly weak and easy to beat; this can
be a starting point for the "easy" AI. 

2. **[Remove redundancies in creating servers](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-poker/issues/65) (50 pts)** - Creating a local server
currently depends too much on the user. The program should take the generated IP address and automatically produce a server, not
return the IP address for the user to input.

3. **[Add music and sounds](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-poker/issues/66) (200 pts)** - Background music and sound effects, such as cards being dealt or a fanfare when the player wins, enhance and provide depth to the gameplay. Add a relaxing tune to be played while the game runs and fitting sound effects for the rest of the gameplay.

4. **[Fix text gathering](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-poker/issues/67) (50 pts)** - During a match, the informative text and prompts cling to the edges of the frame. Adjust these 
portions slightly so there is a small gap between themselves and the edges.
