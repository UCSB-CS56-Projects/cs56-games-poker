Description of Project
======================

This project is a GUI application that runs a poker game in the style of "Texas Hold'em," with two decks, as stated by the README. 


User Stories
============
	The user can do the following:
	
	1. Start a single player game by pressing the "Play Single Player"
	button. The user will compete against AI.

	2. Create a Poker Server (disabled by previous contributers).
	This button creates a local server and returns its IP address, 
	which the user then enters in a separate session via the
	"Connect to Poker Server" button. The user can also distribute
	the IP address to other players willing to join a game.
	
	3. Connect to Poker Server (disabled by previous contributers).
	Takes an IP address and connects the user to its corresponding
	poker game. Inputting "localhost" or the IP address "127.0.0.1"
	connects the user to their local server.

	4. Create Poker Chat Server - Clicking this button creates a 
	socket server for a chat program (similar to #2).
 
	5. Connect to Poker Chat Server - Joins a Chat Server by taking
	an IP address and connecting (similar to #3).
	

Proposed User Stories
=====================

	1. Adjust AI difficulty - Currently, there is no option to change the 
	difficulty level on Single Player Mode. This would present the player
	with "Easy," "Intermediate," and "Hard" difficulties.
	
	2. Play against multiple AIs - The user only encounters one AI in
	Single Player; the option to play against two or more increases the 
	game's complexity and playability.
	
	3. Remove redundancies in creating servers - Creating a local server
	currently depends too much on the user. The program should take
	the generated IP address and automatically produce a server, not
	return the IP address for the user to input.

	4. Restore Multiplayer and Servers.

Software Status
===============

	When the game runs, a window pops up with three buttons:
	Single Player Mode, Create a Chat Server, and Connect to
	Chat. Single Player generates a game between the user and
	AI, which works smoothly. However, creating a Chat Server
	does not function as well as it could. An IP address is returned,
	but the program hangs immediately after. Connecting to the
	Chat Server on the local machine lets the user input their
	chat name and creates a chat window, but nothing occurs
	when the user inputs a string.
