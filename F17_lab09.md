New Issues
==========
1. **Adjust AI difficulty (300 pts)** - Currently, there is no option to change the difficulty level on Single Player Mode. This would present the player with "Easy," "Intermediate," and "Hard" difficulties.

2. **Remove redundancies in creating servers (50 pts)** - Creating a local server
currently depends too much on the user. The program should take the generated IP address and automatically produce a server, not
return the IP address for the user to input.

3. **Add music and sounds (250 pts)** - Sound effects, such as cards being dealt or a fanfare when the player wins, enhance and provide depth to the gameplay. 
Background music can play while the game runs.
