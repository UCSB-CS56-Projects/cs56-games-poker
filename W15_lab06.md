Comments on the project
=======================
The programs runs fine, except the logic in the game is not really there. It only deals the cards in the correct order, but doesn't allow any user interaction. The README also gives no explaination of what the program does, or how to run the program. The code is also repetitive in some areas, so it needs some refactoring.


For Lab06
=========
* Put program into correct package


What To Work On In Lab07
========================
* Update README to explain the game
* Make into playable game
* Keep track of user wins
