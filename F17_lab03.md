## Description of Project

	This project is a GUI application that runs a poker game in the style of "Texas Hold'em," with two decks, as stated by the README. 


## User Stories

	The user can do the following:
	
	1. Start a single player game by pressing the "Play Single Player" button. The user will compete against AI.

	2. Create a Poker Server (disabled by previous contributers). This button creates a local server and returns its IP address, which the user then enters in a separate session via the "Connect to Poker Server" button. The user can also distribute the IP address to other players willing to join a game.
	
	3. Connect to Poker Server (disabled by previous contributers). Takes an IP address and connects the user to its corresponding poker game. Inputting "localhost" or the IP address "127.0.0.1" connects the user to their local server.

	4. Create Poker Chat Server - Clicking this button creates a socket server for a chat program (similar to #2).
 
	5. Connect to Poker Chat Server - Joins a Chat Server by taking an IP address and connecting (similar to #3).
	

	The user *may* want to do the following:

	1. Adjust AI difficulty - Currently, there is no option to change the difficulty level on Single Player Mode. This would present the player with "Easy," "Intermediate," and "Hard" difficulties.
	
	2. Play against multiple AIs - The user only encounters one AI in Single Player; the option to play against two or more increases the game's complexity and playability.
